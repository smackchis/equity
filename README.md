Equity research project. This is my first project on equity analysis. This is just for learning purpose.

Project Plan: The project is divided in multiple blocks based on its function. These blocks need continuous upgrade and code change.

A. DGS (Data gathering and storage) This block is to gather and store all the data needed for equity analysis. The basic concept is to find the source from which data can be downloaded and store it on local disc. For large data sets microsift sql server is used. For ad-hoc and small set of data excel or any other file may be used.

B. DPS (Data processing and storage) This block is to calculate analyses fundamental financial ratios, macroeconomic factors, Technical factors etc from financial data stored in DGS. This will include basic equity analysis fundamental formulas, equity valuation models and self made or other statistical models. The result of these processed data will be stored.

C. Portfolio Construction: This block will compare risk and return of the analysed data and construct a risk based optimal portfolio for investment.

D. Continous rebalancing and reconstitution. This block with monitor the market conditions and data continously and alert the portfolio manager on the rebalancing and reconstitution of portfolios. This has not been thought through yet after block A, B and C start giving desired result this will be kicked off.
